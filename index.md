## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sarrahrose04/orientation2022/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

#1.1 OICs Address
Hey OGLs!

First off, thank you for stepping up to contribute positively to the school as seniors to the incoming batch of Y5s.

The OGL Handbook contains all the information regarding Orientation and will be your guide over these four days. We know it is lengthy, but please take the time to **read through the handbook carefully and thoroughly** to prepare yourselves to carry out the activities for the OGLings. 

As this is the second time we will run an Orientation programme in the midst of a pandemic, rest assured that we have taken everyone’s feedback into consideration and integrated it into our programme this year. With so many Covid-19 restrictions and guidelines, how well Ori goes is very dependent on how you as OGLs, carry out the activities and communicate with your OGLings. We hope that you can go into Orientation with the **mindset of making the best of what we have**, as the OGLings will be taking your cue.

	So don’t be afraid to step forward, encourage participation and have fun! Take this opportunity to **grow as a leader with your other OGLs and remember your responsibility to your OGLings and help them ease into this new environment**. You will be their first point of contact with RI, so we cannot stress enough how important every single one of you are in Orientation. Your attitude towards Orientation determines how much fun both you and the OGLings would have, so be the OGL you would want to have!

	All the best for Orientation! We’re here for you all the way :”) 

Your Orientation ICs,
Jonathan and Sarrah
